Provides an interface for working with the Novation Launchpad in ChucK.  Some
sample uses have been given:

  print.ck - prints messages received from the Launchpad to stdout, to
    illustrate Launchpad input.

  echo.ck - bounces Midi messages back to the Launchpad, to illustrate Launchpad
    output.

  sin.ck - a simple polyphonic sinwave synthesizer, as an example use case that
    actually makes sound.  It's pretty ugly sounding, but it can provide as a
    jump-off spot for more sophisticated instrumentation.

All of the sample scripts will ask you for the Midi channel to read Launchpad
input from.  This can also be specified at the commandline.  I typically launch
a script like this:

  chuck sin:0

which would launch the sin.ck script with "0" as the first parameter.
